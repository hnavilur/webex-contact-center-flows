# Predictive Progressive Campaign Template

## Name
Predictive Progressive Campaign

## Labels 
Predictive, Progressive,Outbound

## Description

Use this template to create a sophisticated outbound campaign flow that uses the Campaign Manager integration where contacts are initiated using predictive or progressive dialing. This is often used for reaching out to customers proactively or when executing outbound campaigns (marketing/sales/proactive outreach).

## Details

This flow provides a setup for outbound campaigns, including handling different call results and error scenarios.

Modify the flow to ensure effective contact management and robust error handling to improve customer engagement.

> Note: The Flow uses Cisco Text-to-speech for all the audio activities that require prompts (if any). 
> 
> 
> For all organization specific configuration activities such as Queue, Entry Points, Connectors, Outdial ANI, etc. those need to be manually configured by the user before the template is published.

### Pre-requisites

- This flow uses Cisco TTS(Text-to-speech). Upload required static audio files if using your own audio for the prompts.
- Ensure that the following requirements are met in the Webex Contact Center Management Portal before implementing this flow:
 1. Create Outdial Entry Points, Out dial queues, teams, and entry point mappings, and any other organization-specific configurations such as connectors, outdial ANI, and more.
 2.	A flow must be configured with each campaign, referenced by the outdial entrypoint. The flow is simple but dictates which variables are shown on the agent desktop and in which order. This is done via global variables. Configure variables in the flow as required. 
 3.	Global variables should be configured for each variable imported into the contact list which is desired to be utilized in the flow or potentially eventually passed to the agent desktop. The global variable name(s) should match the variable name in the import list. 

> **Note: You must configure this customer data on the desktop layout in the flow within the incoming popover section. The incoming popover does not support sensitive data. [Download Desktop Layout](https://github.com/WebexCC/webexcc.github.io/blob/master/assets/Acqueon_Desktop_Layout.json)**

### Flow Breakdown

1. Contact Initiation: The flow starts with initiating a new phone contact.
2. Contact Handling: The flow evaluates call results like answering machine detection or abandoned calls and handles them accordingly.
3. Error Management: Provides mechanisms for error handling and offers solutions like retrying calls.
4. Flow Conclusion: Ends with the disconnect activity after handling the contact.

### Activities Used

**Start**

- The flow begins with the initiation of a new phone contact.

**Case Evaluation**

- Evaluates the call results and directs the flow based on conditions like AMD (Answering Machine Detection) and Abandoned due to agents are busy.


**Play Message**

- Uses Text-to-Speech to convey messages for voicemail greetings or capacity messages when agents are busy.


**Disconnect**

- Ends the interaction by disconnecting the call after handling the contact.

**Event Flows**

- Event flows are used for Outbound Campaign Result to make decisions and continue the flow.
